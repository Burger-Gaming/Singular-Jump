Welcome to Singular Jump!
This was just a small game I decided to make in about 3 days.

CONTROLS (Arrow Keys):
Left & Right - Move
Up - Jump

The objective of the game is to not fall into the pot! There are a few difficulties implemented. Here's how each difficulty works:

Easy - The pot does not rise up to increase difficulty. Your score won't save on this one.
Normal - The pot rises in difficulty.
Hard - Platforms will move at random speeds while the pot rises in difficulty.

The harder difficulty you choose, the wider the range for platforms to spawn will be, making jumps trickier to land.
